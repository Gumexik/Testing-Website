            <h2>What is Compliance Testing?</h2>
            <p>Compliance testing, also known as conformance testing, is a type of software testing to determine whether a software product, process, computer program, or system meets a defined set of internal or external standards before it’s released into production. An integral part of the software testing life cycle, compliance testing is used to ensure the compliance of deliverables of each phase of the development process.</p>

            <h2>When to use Compliance Testing</h2>
            <p class="justify-width">It is solely the management’s call. If they want, they have to enforce sufficient tests to validate the degree of compliance to the methodology and identify the violators. But it may be possible that lack of compliance is due NOT understanding the methodology or they are misunderstood.
            Management should ensure that the teams have a proper and clear understanding of the standards, procedures, and methodology. They can arrange proper training for the team if needed. It may be possible that the standards are not published properly or maybe that the standards itself are of poor quality. In such a situation, efforts should be made either to rectify it or to adopt a new methodology. It is important that the compliance check should be made right from the inception of the project than at the later stage because it would be difficult to correct the application when the requirement itself is not adequately documented.</p>
