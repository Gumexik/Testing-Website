            <h2>What is System Testing?</h2>
            <p>System Testing is a level of testing that validates the complete and fully integrated software product. The purpose of a system test is to evaluate the end-to-end system specifications. Usually, the software is only one element of a larger computer-based system. Ultimately, the software is interfaced with other software/hardware systems. System Testing is actually a series of different tests whose sole purpose is to exercise the full computer-based system.</p>

            <h2>How To Perform System Test?</h2>
            <p class="justify-width">It is basically a part of software testing and the Test Plan should always contain specific space for this testing. To test the system as a whole, requirements and expectations should be clear and the tester needs to understand the real-time usage of the application too. Also, most used third-party tools, versions of OSes, flavors and architecture of OSes can affect the systemâ€™s functionality, performance, security, recoverability or installability. Therefore, while testing the system a clear picture of how the application is going to be used and what kind of issues it can face in real-time can be helpful. In addition to that, a requirements document is as important as understanding the application. Clear and updated requirements document can save tester from a number of misunderstandings, assumptions, and questions. In short, a pointed and crisp requirement document with the latest updates along with an understanding of real-time application usage can make ST more fruitful. This testing is done in a planned and systematic manner.</p>
